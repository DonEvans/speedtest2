# Ruby on Rails: Computer Speed Test

This app uses javascript to test the speed of your computer's processor and Javascript engine. Rails 6.0.1 is used to store the results. The app is hosted on heroku at www.computer-speed-test.us

Using Javascript allows the test to conveniently be run on a wide variety of systems. 

It also includes several static pages comparing the speed of different languages and browsers. Older browsers are very much slower.

This is an update of an earlier Rails 3 app
